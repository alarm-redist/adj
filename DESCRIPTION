Description: Provides an S3 class to represent graph adjacency lists using 'vctrs'.
    Allows for creation, subsetting, combining, and pretty printing of these lists.
    This class can further be reindexed to allow for zero-indexed lists which
    allows for easy passing of objects to low-level languages for processing.
